# How to



`yarn` or `npm install` - installs the node dependencies

`yarn dev` or `npm run dev` - starts the development server listening on port 3000

`yarn build && yarn start` - builds and starts the production version listening on port 3000

> Hint: you can use `npm run` instead of `yarn`

`yarn test` - runs jest and react-testing-framework tests on the components of the app

`yarn cypress` - opens cypress e2e and makes screenshots of app state. Requires the app to be running on localhost:3000
